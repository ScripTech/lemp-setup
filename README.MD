# Automating Efficiency: Installing the LEMP Stack with Ease! ðŸš€

In my recent work with Linode servers, I often relied on the one-click feature to deploy a LEMP stack. However, I found that it didnâ€™t always work as expected. Through investigation and conversations with others, I realized I wasnâ€™t aloneâ€”many faced similar challenges.

Thankfully, Linode provides solid documentation for setting up LEMP on bare metal, but manual installation can be time-consuming, especially when managing multiple servers. So, I decided to streamline the process.

I created a Bash script that automates the installation of the LEMP stack, performing all the necessary steps and validating them during execution. This script has saved me countless hours, and I hope it can do the same for others in the community!

Are you dealing with similar deployment challenges? Or have you automated other server management tasks? Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and ideas! Letâ€™s connect and share knowledge! ðŸ’¬


## Running LEMP Setup
```bash
user@ezetsu-lab /script curl https://github.com/ScripTech/lemp-setup/blob/main/install-lemp.sh
user@ezetsu-lab /script sudo bash install-lemp.sh
```
